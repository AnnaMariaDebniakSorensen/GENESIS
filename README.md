## 🌌 What is GENESIS?

GENESIS is a falsifiable, torsion-based cosmological model that replaces singularities with solitonic cores, explains dark matter and dark energy geometrically, and proposes a new spacetime born through a signature phase transition.

It combines:

- Einstein–Cartan geometry with dynamical torsion  
- Spin-aligned collapse leading to a solitonic structure (Torus AM)  
- A metric flip that initiates a new causal domain  
- Emergent structure formation and dark matter from geometric defects  
- Consciousness as a resonance within ordered torsion
