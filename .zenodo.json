  "description": "GENESIS is a falsifiable cosmological framework based on dynamical torsion geometry. It replaces singularities with solitonic structures (Torus AM), explains dark matter and dark energy through geometry, and proposes a new spacetime created by a metric signature flip. Includes full derivations, observables, numerical methods, appendices A–Z, and a poetic narrative.",
