# TorsionScal Thorn – GENESIS Implementation for Einstein Toolkit

This thorn evolves a massive pseudo-scalar torsion field based on the GENESIS model.  
The evolution is governed by a signature-flip–triggered phase transition and Yukawa self-interaction.

Implements Eq. (13) and (86) from the GENESIS-10 preprint:
