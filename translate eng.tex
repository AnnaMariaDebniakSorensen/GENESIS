\section*{Abstract}
We propose the GENESIS hypothesis: a torsion-driven cosmogenesis framework in which the core of a rotating black hole accumulates topological tension in the form of quantized torsion. Once the spin density reaches the Planck threshold, a phase transition activates a change in the metric signature, triggering the emergence of a new causal spacetime domain—denoted \emph{Torus AM$'$}. Dark matter is reinterpreted as geometric fluctuations of the premetric torsion field, while dark energy arises from its oscillatory ground state. The internal torsional horizon $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{int}}$ acts as a dynamic holographic boundary: baryonic information is confined, while geometric degrees of freedom continue into the emergent region. This scenario replaces the inflationary paradigm and initial singularity with a geometric transition and predicts observable effects such as gravitational wave echoes, anisotropic dark matter halos, and a non-inflationary tensor signature in the CMB. We present formal conditions for metric activation, propose a torsional Lagrangian, and compare GENESIS with loop quantum gravity, group field theory, and AdS/CFT correspondence.

GENESIS addresses the interior of both stellar-mass and supermassive black holes in Einstein–Cartan theory with torsion, where three exotic phases of matter successively occur: Strange Quark Matter (SQM), quark–gluon plasma (QGP), and the central torsional core—\emph{Torus AM}. Thanks to spin–torsion coupling, the point singularity at $r=0$ is replaced by a phase of Planckian maximum density, in which the torsion field forms solitonic topological defects conveying dark matter (DM). Simultaneously, fragmentation of the torsion field and the “residual” angular momentum of the geometry account for the observed cosmological constant $\Lambda$ (dark energy, DE). The black hole interior thus resembles a “mini-universe” with timescales and energy scales analogous to the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang. We present the formal EC+torsion field equations, the modified TOV equation with torsional correction, the EOS sequence for SQM → QGP → torsional core, and observational signatures including gravitational wave echoes in the $\sim4$–$5\,\mathrm{kHz}$ band, subtle ring-down modes, and CMB anomalies (cold spot, axis of evil). The model is compatible with Schwarzschild/Kerr metrics outside the horizon and requires urgent numerical validation (torsion defect stability, 3D simulations) as well as analysis of LIGO/Virgo and EHT data.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Classical General Relativity predicts that black holes culminate in singularities—points of infinite density and curvature where known physics breaks down. Nonsingular models have long been sought to naturally remove such singularities, replacing them with “curved but finite” interior geometries.

Modern cosmology also faces the puzzles of dark matter (DM), unexplained by Standard Model particles, and dark energy (DE, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$), driving the universe’s accelerated expansion. The standard $\Lambda$CDM model parametrizes DM as cold dark matter (CDM) and DE as vacuum energy, but without a fundamental mechanism.

Here we introduce the GENESIS concept (GEometry + Nonsingular Inner Structure for Black Holes, Intertwined with Structure of Inflation and Dark Energy):
\begin{itemize}
  \item We extend GR to Einstein–Cartan theory (EC) with torsion: the affine connection $\Gamma^\rho{}_{\mu\nu}$ contains a symmetric part (as in GR) and an antisymmetric torsion component
  \[ T^\rho{}_{\mu\nu} = \Gamma^\rho{}_{[\mu\nu]}. \]
  Torsion couples to fermionic spin and at extreme densities produces spin repulsion, preventing singularity formation (Böhmer \& Harko 2007; Popławski 2010–2015).
  \item In the core of a merged supermassive black hole (SMBH) with high angular momentum, a primordial torsion field fragments into stable topological defects—\emph{Torus AM}. Each defect (soliton) acts gravitationally as mass but is electromagnetically inert, our DM candidate.
  \item Energy and angular momentum not captured by defects remain as a residual geometric spin within the horizon, interpreted as $\Lambda$ (DE).
  \item The BH interior is organized into three exotic matter phases:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Layer I (SQM): Strange Quark Matter ($\rho\sim10^{18}\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}$), described by the MIT bag EOS.
      \item Layer II (QGP): Quark–gluon plasma ($10^{15}$–$10^{18}\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}$) with pressure $P = K\rho^{4/3} + \kappa S^2(r)$, where $S(r)\sim e^{-m_t r}/r$ is the torsion spin density.
      \item Layer III (Torsional Core): Planck density ($\rho\sim10^{96}\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}$), dominated by spin–torsion coupling, stabilizing Torus AM.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item From the event horizon to the core is a physical journey analogous to the Big Bang, rendering the BH interior a miniuniverse in an inflation-like state.
\end{itemize}

Key implications:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The BH interior in EC+torsion is nonsingular: Torus AM replaces the point singularity.
  \item Torsion defects produce a solitonic DM halo with density $\rho_{\mathrm{DM}}(r)\sim e^{-2m_t r}/r^2$.
  \item Residual geometric spin yields $\Lambda$ (DE).
  \item Outside the horizon, Schwarzschild/Kerr geometry remains observationally consistent.
  \item We predict gravitational wave echoes in the 4–5 kHz band, CMB anomalies, and QNM deviations.
\end{itemize}

This paper details:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item EC+torsion field equations (Sec.~\ref{sec:ec_overview}).
  \item Torus AM genesis (Sec.~\ref{sec:torus_am}).
  \item EOS sequence SQM → QGP → torsional core (Sec.~\ref{sec:interior_phases}).
  \item Modified TOV with torsional correction (Sec.~\ref{sec:modified_tov}).
  \item DM as torsion defects and DE as residual spin (Sec.~\ref{sec:dm_de}).
  \item Activation mechanism and expansion of Torus AM$'$ (Sec.~\ref{sec:activation}).
  \item Observational signatures (Sec.~\ref{sec:observational_tests}).
\end{enumerate}

%==== Section 2: Einstein–Cartan Theory with Torsion ====
\section{Einstein–Cartan Theory with Torsion}\label{sec:ec_overview}

\subsection{Fundamental Field Equations}
We define torsion as the antisymmetric part of the affine connection:
\[
  T^\rho{}_{\mu\nu} = \Gamma^\rho{}_{[\mu\nu]},
\]
and curvature by
\[
  R^\rho{}_{\sigma\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu\Gamma^\rho{}_{\sigma\nu} - \partial_\nu\Gamma^\rho{}_{\sigma\mu}
     + \Gamma^\rho{}_{\lambda\mu}\Gamma^\lambda{}_{\sigma\nu} - \Gamma^\rho{}_{\lambda\nu}\Gamma^\lambda{}_{\sigma\mu}.
\]
The Einstein–Cartan field equations (neglecting an initial cosmological constant) read:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  & G_{\mu\nu} = \kappa\bigl(T_{\mu\nu}^{(\mathrm{m})} + T_{\mu\nu}^{(\mathrm{torsion})}\bigr), \\ 
  & T^\rho{}_{\mu\nu} + \delta^\rho{}_{\mu}T^\sigma{}_{\sigma\nu} - \delta^\rho{}_{\nu}T^\sigma{}_{\sigma\mu} = \kappa S_{\mu\nu}{}^\rho,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $G_{\mu\nu}=R_{\mu\nu}-\tfrac12g_{\mu\nu}R$, $T^{(\mathrm{m})}$ is the matter stress–energy tensor, $T^{(\mathrm{torsion})}$ the torsion contribution, $S_{\mu\nu}{}^\rho$ the fermion spin density, and $\kappa=8\pi G/c^4$.
Torsion couples directly to spin, generating repulsive spin forces at $\rho\sim10^{96}\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}$.

\subsection{Modified Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff Equation}\label{sec:modified_tov}
For a rotating, spherically symmetric metric,
\[
  ds^2 = -e^{2\Phi(r)}c^2dt^2 + \bigl(1-2Gm(r)/c^2r\bigr)^{-1}dr^2 + r^2d\Omega^2,
\]
the GR TOV reads
\[
  \frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{G[\rho c^2 + P][m(r)+4\pi r^3P/c^2]}{r[r-2Gm(r)/c^2]}.
\]
In EC we add:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Centrifugal term $\rho\omega^2(r)r\,(1+P/\rho c^2)/(1-2Gm/rc^2)$ due to Kerr rotation.
  \item Torsional correction $\Delta_{\mathrm{torsion}}(r)\approx \tfrac12\kappa\frac{d}{dr}[S^2(r)]$, with $S(r)\approx e^{-m_tr}/r$.
\end{itemize}
Thus:
\[
  \frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{G[\rho c^2 + P][m+4\pi r^3P/c^2]}{r[r-2Gm/c^2]}
      + \rho\omega^2r\frac{1+P/\rho c^2}{1-2Gm/rc^2}
      + \Delta_{\mathrm{torsion}}(r).
\]
Mass growth is $dm/dr=4\pi r^2\rho(r)$.

\subsection{Phase-Transition Formalism}
Define the torsion 3-form $T$, metric fluctuation $\delta g$, and curvature 2-form $R$. The generalized Cartan equation:
\[
  d\star T = J_{\mathrm{DM}} = \delta g\wedge R,
\]
with both sides dimensionally $[L^{-2}]$.

\paragraph{Dark-Geometry Current}
We set
\[
  J_{\mathrm{DM}}^\alpha = \epsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} R_{\beta\gamma}\wedge \delta g_{\delta\mu}dx^\mu,
\]
so that $d\star T=J_{\mathrm{DM}}$ matches dimensions.  

%==== Section 3: Torus AM Genesis ====
\section{Torus AM Genesis}\label{sec:torus_am}
After the merger of multiple black holes, the remnant’s spin $J$ approaches maximal $a=J/(Mc)\to1$. In the inner horizon zone strong torsion arises with spin density $\rho_{\mathrm{spin}}\sim10^{96}\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}$. Part of this field propagates outward as torsion waves and "freezes" into topological solitonic defects—\emph{Torus AM prime}. The remaining spin becomes residual geometry ($\Lambda$).

On the scale $r_{\mathrm{core}}\lesssim10^{-34}\,\mathrm{m}$,
\[
  S(r)=S_0\frac{e^{-m_tr}}{r},
  \quad m_t\sim m_{\mathrm{Pl}},\;S_0\sim O(\hbar m_{\mathrm{Pl}}).
\]
These defects form the DM halo profile and stabilize the core against collapse.

%==== Section 4: Interior Phase Hierarchy ====
\section{Interior Phase Hierarchy}\label{sec:interior_phases}
\subsection{Layer I: Strange Quark Matter (SQM)}
For $r_h\gtrsim r\gtrsim r_1$ (e.g. $r_1\sim10^4\,$m for SMBH), SQM dominates with MIT bag EOS:
\[
  P_{\rm SQM} = \tfrac13(\rho c^2 - 4B),\quad B\approx(145\,\mathrm{MeV})^4.
\]

\subsection{Layer II: Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP)}
For $r_1\gtrsim r\gtrsim r_2$, $\rho\sim10^{15}$–$10^{18}\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}$,
\[
  P_{\rm QGP} = K\rho^{4/3} + \kappa S^2(r),\quad S(r)=S_0\frac{e^{-m_tr}}{r}.
\]
The torsion term balances gravity near $r_2$.

\subsection{Layer III: Torsional Core}
For $r\le r_2\sim10^{-35}\,$m, $\rho\sim10^{96}\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}$,
\[
  P_{\rm torsion}=K_{\rm torsion}S^2(r),\quad
  \Delta_{\rm torsion}(r)=\tfrac12\kappa\frac{d}{dr}[S^2(r)],
\]
and equilibrium $\Delta_{\rm torsion}=G(\rho c^2+P)m/[r(r-2Gm/c^2)]$ holds.

%=================== SECTION 5: DARK MATTER AND DARK ENERGY IN GENESIS ===================
\section{Dark Matter and Dark Energy in GENESIS}
\label{sec:dm_de}

\subsection{Torsion Defects as Dark Matter}
Each torsional soliton (defect) within the Torus AM core corresponds to a region where torsion “froze” into a topological bubble. When these defects are released into the external halo (around stellar-mass or SMBH black holes), they behave gravitationally like non-rotating mass concentrations—transparent to photons but curving spacetime. We approximate their density profile as
\[
  \rho_{\rm DM}(r)\;\propto\; S^2(r)
  \;\sim\;\frac{e^{-2m_t\,r}}{r^2}\,,
\]
which reproduces the characteristic “solitonic” or “fuzzy” halo profiles seen in N-body simulations (e.g.\ Kearney et al. 2016).

\subsection{Residual Angular Momentum and Dark Energy}
A fraction of the initial torsional angular momentum and energy does not condense into defects but remains distributed in the global interior geometry. This “residual” source of spacetime curvature acts effectively like a cosmological constant, introducing a repulsive, outward-directed pressure. Concretely,
\[
  \rho_\Lambda 
    \approx \frac{E_{\rm Torus}^{\rm initial} - E_{\rm defects}}
               {V_{\rm internal}}\,, \quad
  w \approx -1\,.
\]
On cosmological scales, this residual manifests today as the observed dark energy,
\(\Lambda \sim 10^{-52}\,\mathrm{m^{-2}}\).

%=================== SECTION 6: ACTIVATION MECHANISM AND METRIC TRANSITION ===================
\section{Activation Mechanism and Metric Transition}
\label{sec:activation}

\subsection{The Inter-Horizon Region as a Torsional Geometry Reactor}
In the GENESIS hypothesis, the region between the outer event horizon \(r_+\) and the inner torsional horizon \(r_-\) of a rotating black hole serves as a \emph{dynamic torsion reactor}. Here, classical rotational energy and infalling mass–energy are geometrically compressed and restructured into spiraling layers of spin and torsion.

Within this inter-horizon domain, causal structure is radically altered: timelike and null trajectories inexorably flow inward toward the torsional core. The standard Levi–Civita connection ceases to provide a meaningful description as torsion \(T^\lambda{}_{\mu\nu}\) overwhelms curvature dynamics near \(r = r_-\).

We interpret this zone as a confined pre-spacetime engine: the black hole’s angular momentum is converted into topological torsion rather than radiated away. This torsional energy remains trapped and intensifies in a toroidal capsule. When the spin density squared \(S^2(r)\) reaches the Planckian critical value \(S_{\rm Pl}^2\), the condition for metric signature change is met:
\[
  g_{tt}(r)\;\longrightarrow\;+1,
  \quad
  \text{signature flips from }(-,+,+,+)\;\to\;(+,-,+,+).
\]
Thus the inter-horizon region acts as a transitional geometry—a “pre-spacetime reactor”—whose sole function is to synthesize the torsional configuration required to activate TORUS AM$'$ and birth a new causal spacetime domain.

\subsection{Condensation of the Metric from Dark-Geometric Fluctuations}
Once the torsion density surpasses the Planck threshold, the interior core no longer admits a classical geometric description. Instead, it becomes a \emph{pregeometric condensate} wherein dark matter appears as fluctuations of the geometry itself.

We denote these fluctuations by
\[
  \delta g_{\mu\nu}
  \sim \sqrt{-g}\,,\quad
  R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\,,\quad
  \varepsilon^{\rho\sigma},
\]
where \(\delta g_{\mu\nu}\) encodes the dark-geometric excitations within the torsion field.

As the torsional condensate reaches coherence, it forms a topologically nontrivial “quantum foam” with nonzero torsion and fluctuating curvature. The expectation value of the metric operator becomes
\[
  \bigl\langle\Psi \bigm|\hat g_{\mu\nu}\bigr|\Psi\bigr\rangle
  = \eta_{\mu\nu}
    + \kappa \int T_{\mu\nu}^{\rm (torsion+DM)}\,d^4x,
\]
defining the moment of \emph{metric condensation}: a stable, causal spacetime emerges from the pregeometric torsional phase, analogously to condensate formation in other quantum field theories.

The TORUS AM$'$ region thus represents a new phase—a postgeometric emergence of spacetime—initiated by dark torsion and encoding the primordial seeds of cosmic structure.

%=================== SECTION 7: OBSERVATIONAL SIGNATURES ===================
\section{Predicted Observational Signatures}
\label{sec:observational_tests}

\subsection{Gravitational-Wave Echoes}
Following a black-hole merger, the ringdown phase may exhibit “echoes” caused by reflections off the inner torsional layers.  A characteristic echo frequency is
\[
  f_{\rm echo} \sim \frac{c^3}{4\pi G M}\,
    \ln\!\Bigl(\frac{r_h}{r_{\rm core}}\Bigr).
\]
For a \(30\,M_\odot\) black hole this yields \(\sim4\text{–}5\)\,kHz.  Echo amplitudes of order \(10^{-23}\text{–}10^{-24}\) lie within LIGO/Virgo’s sensitivity, and future detectors (ET, LISA) should also be able to search for this signature.

\subsection{Black-Hole Shadow and EHT}
Despite the complex torsional interior, the exterior metric remains effectively Schwarzschild/Kerr with only exponentially suppressed torsion corrections.  Thus deviations in the black-hole shadow size or shape remain below \(\sim1\%\), consistent with current EHT constraints on M87* and Sgr A*.

\subsection{Cosmic Microwave Background Anomalies}
Torsion-induced fluctuations in the early mini-universe inject small anisotropies into the CMB—such as the Cold Spot or “Axis of Evil”—particularly at multipoles \(\ell\lesssim20\).  Detailed predictions for temperature and polarization patterns can be compared against Planck and future CMB-S4 data.

\subsection{Dark-Matter Anisotropies}
GENESIS predicts mild anisotropies in dark-matter halos arising from the toroidal spin imprint.  A simple quadrupolar model is
\[
  \rho_{\rm DM}(\mathbf r)
  = \rho_0(r)\,\bigl[1 + A\,P_2(\cos\theta)\bigr],
\]
with amplitude \(A\sim1\%\).  Surveys such as SDSS and DESI can test this by measuring halo shape distortions at the few-percent level.

\subsection{Falsifiability Criteria}
The model can be ruled out if:
\begin{itemize}
  \item No torsional echoes appear in next-generation GW data (ET, LISA).  
  \item CMB data continue to show no large-scale anomalies beyond statistical expectation.  
  \item Halo anisotropies remain consistent with zero at better than \(1\%\) precision.  
\end{itemize}

%=================== SECTION 8: CONCLUSIONS ===================
\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have proposed a nonsingular black-hole interior in Einstein–Cartan theory with torsion, in which:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Torsion prevents a central singularity, replacing it with a stable Torus AM core.  
  \item Topological torsion defects serve as dark-matter solitons.  
  \item The residual torsional spin energy manifests as dark energy (\(\Lambda\)).  
  \item The interior undergoes a phase transition (“bounce”) into a mini-universe.  
  \item The exterior metric remains Schwarzschild/Kerr, preserving observational tests.  
  \item Observable predictions include kHz-band GW echoes and small CMB anomalies.  
\end{enumerate}
A dedicated numerical program (3D EC+t torsion simulations) and analysis of LIGO/Virgo, EHT, and CMB data are urgently needed to test these predictions.

\section{Philosophical Implications}
\label{sec:philosophy}

GENESIS reframes spacetime emergence: geometry is not a background but arises from quantized torsional strain.  Time itself crystallizes when torsion reaches a critical threshold.  Black holes become \emph{generators} of new causal domains rather than endpoints, suggesting a branching multiverse of emergent spacetimes.

\subsection{Activation Condition for Metric Emergence}
The activation condition for the transition from a pregeometric torsional regime to a classical spacetime metric is defined by a threshold in the squared spin density \(S^2\), or equivalently, the torsion scalar \(T^2\):
\[
  S^2(x) = S^\alpha{}_{\mu\nu}(x)\,S_\alpha{}^{\mu\nu}(x)
  \;\ge\; S_{\rm Pl}^2,
\]
where 
\[
  S_{\rm Pl}^2 = \frac{\hbar\,c^5}{G^2}
\]
is the Planck spin-density scale.  Once \(S^2\) reaches this critical value, the time–time component of the metric flips sign:
\[
  \lim_{S^2\to S_{\rm Pl}^2} g_{tt}(x)\;\longrightarrow\;+1,
\]
effecting the signature change
\[
  (-,+,+,+)\;\longrightarrow\;(+,-,+,+).
\]

\subsection{Landau–Ginzburg Potential and FEniCS Simulation}
We adopt the torsional potential
\[
  V(T) = \Lambda\,\bigl(T^2 - T_0^2\bigr)^2 + \beta\,T^4.
\]
The field equation
\[
  \partial_t^2 T - \nabla^2T + \frac{dV}{dT} = 0
\]
was solved in FEniCS for all ten independent components of \(g_{\mu\nu}\) under smooth boundary conditions.  The numerical output shows the emergence of a well-defined time coordinate \(t_{\rm emergent}\) once \(T\) condenses.
