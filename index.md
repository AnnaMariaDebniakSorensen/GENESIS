# GENESIS

ðŸŒŒ *for minds that never stopped asking*

## About

GENESIS is a falsifiable cosmological model based on Einsteinâ€“Cartan geometry.  
It explains dark matter and dark energy as geometric effects of torsion.  
It replaces singularities with solitonic structures and initiates a new spacetime via metric signature change.
