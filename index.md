ðŸŒŒ *for minds that never stopped asking*

## About

**GENESIS** is a falsifiable cosmological model based on Einsteinâ€“Cartan geometry with dynamical torsion.  
It replaces singularities with solitonic structures (Torus AM), explains dark matter and dark energy geometrically, and proposes a new spacetime born through a metric signature flip.

The model is testable through:

- Gravitational wave echoes (1â€“2 kHz, 4.5 kHz)  
- Dipole anisotropies in galaxy spins  
- Signature-induced structure formation  
- Natural dark energy from torsion tension  
- Emergent baryon asymmetry  

GENESIS also includes a poetic narrative designed to explain cosmogenesis for curious minds of all ages.
