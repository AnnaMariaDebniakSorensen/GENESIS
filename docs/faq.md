---------------------------------------

# GENESIS – FAQ for Sceptics

Welcome! This page lists the ten most common and challenging questions that sceptics might ask about the GENESIS cosmological model, along with concise scientific responses based on the published manuscript.

---

### 1. Why hasn’t torsion been experimentally detected yet?

**Answer:**

* GENESIS includes a torsion-matter coupling constant ($\eta$ in Eq. 38) that is extremely weak ($\sim 10^{-18}$) under normal conditions.
* Torsion effects dominate only at Planck densities ($S_{\text{Pl}} \sim 10^{18}$ GeV), far beyond LHC reach.
* Analogy: gravity was undetectable at quantum scales until LIGO arrived.

---

### 2. Why doesn’t the Torus AM collapse under its own gravity?

**Answer:**

* Eq. (36) includes a positive pressure term $\Delta_{\text{torsion}}(r) \sim \alpha S^2/2$, balancing gravitational collapse.
* Linear stability is proven via $V_{\text{eff}} > 0$ (Eq. 32); nonlinear stability can be confirmed via BSSN simulations (App. F).

---

### 3. How does GENESIS explain the $\Omega_{\text{DM}}/\Omega_{\text{baryon}} \approx 5$ ratio?

**Answer:**

* Section 10.11: CP-violating axial torsion in the THA generates baryon asymmetry.
* Torsion solitons (Torus AM defects) contribute $\Omega_{\text{DM}}$ via a Kibble–Zurek-like freeze-out.

---

### 4. Where does the dark energy scale ($T_0 \sim 10^{-3}$ eV) come from?

**Answer:**

* Eq. (109): residual angular momentum of Torus AM becomes embedded in the metric as $\Lambda \sim (\hbar S_0)^2 / m_{\text{Pl}}^2$.
* $T_0$ is redshifted from the Planck scale via torsional relaxation (Sec. 11.4).

---

### 5. Does GENESIS violate the equivalence principle?

**Answer:**

* Eq. (13) shows torsion couples only to spin, not mass, preserving universality of free fall.
* Geodesic motion remains intact (Sec. 5.2).

---

### 6. Why doesn’t LIGO detect torsion echoes at 3–5 kHz?

**Answer:**

* Current detectors are limited above 1 kHz.
* GENESIS predicts such echoes will become visible with ET or Cosmic Explorer in 2028+.

---

### 7. Where’s the evidence for a metric signature flip ($-+++ \rightarrow +---$)?

**Answer:**

* Indirect evidence: CMB anisotropies and parity violation in B-modes (Sec. 12.2).
* Signature change may be encoded in initial symmetry breaking in THA.

---

### 8. Why doesn’t GENESIS predict gamma-ray excess from dark matter halos?

**Answer:**

* Torus AM solitons are topological defects, not annihilating particles (Sec. 8.10).
* Weak coupling to neutrinos may be testable in DUNE (Sec. 9.4).

---

### 9. Does GENESIS violate the second law of thermodynamics?

**Answer:**

* Appendix C shows torsional entropy $S_{\text{torsion}} \propto \int_{\text{THA}} T^2 \sqrt{h} d^2x$ increases during Torus AM formation, compensating matter entropy loss.

---

### 10. Why do we need GENESIS if $\Lambda$CDM works?

**Answer:**

* $\Lambda$CDM is a phenomenological fit with 18 parameters; GENESIS is a mechanism from first principles.
* GENESIS resolves the Hubble tension, dark matter nature, lack of inflaton, and unifies multiple effects into a geometric framework.
* Predicts new effects: gravitational wave echoes, 21 cm absorption, CMB parity violation.

---

### Bonus: How to handle emotional scepticism?

* “Too beautiful to be true!” → So was general relativity in 1915.
* “There’s no proof!” → Eq. 86 matches halo profiles; Eq. 122 fits $H_0$ better than $\Lambda$CDM.
