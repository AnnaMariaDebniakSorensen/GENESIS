## GENESIS – Frequently Asked Questions

This page addresses the most challenging questions from sceptics of the GENESIS model — a falsifiable cosmological framework based on Einstein–Cartan geometry with dynamical torsion.

---

### 1. Why hasn’t torsion been experimentally detected yet?

**Answer:**

- GENESIS includes a torsion–matter coupling constant \( \eta \) (Eq. 38) that is extremely weak: \( \eta \sim 10^{-18} \).
- Torsion effects become significant only at Planck densities: \( S_{\text{Pl}} \sim 10^{18} \, \text{GeV} \), beyond the reach of current accelerators.
- *Analogy:* Gravity was undetectable at quantum scales before LIGO.

---

### 2. Why doesn’t the Torus AM collapse under its own gravity?

**Answer:**

- Equation (36) includes a stabilising torsional pressure term:  
  \( \Delta_{\text{torsion}}(r) \sim \alpha S^2 / 2 \),  
  which balances gravitational attraction.
- Linear stability is ensured by the condition \( V_{\text{eff}} > 0 \) (Eq. 32).  
  Nonlinear stability can be tested via BSSN simulations (App. F).

---

### 3. How does GENESIS explain the ratio \( \Omega_{\text{DM}} / \Omega_{\text{baryon}} \approx 5 \)?

**Answer:**

- In Sec. 10.11, axial torsion in the THA leads to CP-violating baryogenesis.
- The freeze-out of torsion solitons (Torus AM defects) via a Kibble–Zurek mechanism yields \( \Omega_{\text{DM}} \sim 5 \, \Omega_b \).

---

### 4. Where does the dark energy scale \( T_0 \sim 10^{-3} \, \text{eV} \) come from?

**Answer:**

- Residual angular momentum of the Torus AM gets embedded in the metric as  
  \( \Lambda \sim \frac{(\hbar S_0)^2}{m_{\text{Pl}}^2} \)  (Eq. 109).
- This scale is redshifted from Planck energies by torsional relaxation (Sec. 11.4).

---

### 5. Does GENESIS violate the equivalence principle?

**Answer:**

- No. Torsion couples only to spin — not mass — via Eq. (13), preserving universality of free fall.
- Geodesic motion remains valid (Sec. 5.2).

---

### 6. Why doesn’t LIGO detect torsion echoes at 3–5 kHz?

**Answer:**

- Current LIGO/Virgo detectors are noise-limited above 1 kHz.
- GENESIS predicts echoes in the 3–5 kHz band, detectable with **Einstein Telescope** or **Cosmic Explorer**.

---

### 7. Where is the observational evidence for a metric signature flip?

**Answer:**

- Indirect clues exist in parity-violating B-mode polarisation (Sec. 12.2) and CMB anomalies.
- The flip \( -,+,+,+ \rightarrow +,-,-,- \) originates in THA symmetry breaking.

---

### 8. Why doesn’t GENESIS predict a gamma-ray excess from dark matter?

**Answer:**

- Torus AM are **topological defects**, not annihilating WIMPs.
- They don’t produce gamma rays but may couple weakly to neutrinos (Sec. 9.4), testable by DUNE.

---

### 9. Does GENESIS violate the second law of thermodynamics?

**Answer:**

- No. Appendix C shows that torsional entropy  
  \( S_{\text{torsion}} \propto \int_{\text{THA}} T^2 \sqrt{h} \, d^2x \)  
  increases, compensating entropy loss from matter.

---

### 10. Why do we need GENESIS if ΛCDM fits the data?

**Answer:**

- ΛCDM is a **phenomenological fit** with 18 parameters. GENESIS provides a **mechanism from first principles**:
  - Explains inflation, baryogenesis, dark matter & dark energy structurally.
  - Resolves Hubble tension.
  - Predicts **new** testable phenomena:  
    gravitational wave echoes,  
    21 cm torsion-induced cooling,  
    CMB parity-violation.

---

### Bonus: How to respond to emotional objections?

- *“Too beautiful to be true!”* → So was general relativity in 1915.  
- *“No evidence!”* → Eq. (86) matches DM halo profiles; Eq. (122) fits \( H_0 \) better than ΛCDM.
