# GENESIS — for minds that never stopped asking

Welcome to a journey through light, torsion, collapse, symmetry, and consciousness — told in the language of metaphor and wonder.

This poetic version of the GENESIS model invites readers of all ages to explore the cosmos from within:  
- as a photon,  
- as a star,  
- as a question waiting to be asked.
